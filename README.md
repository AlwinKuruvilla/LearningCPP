# LearningCPP

This project is my first attempt at learning C++. 

The course that I'm using is the first course of LinkedIn Learning's path called *Become a C++ Developer* found here:

The course name is *Learning C++* taught by Eduardo Corpe√±o:

In addition to this course, I'm learning to use Jetbrains' CLion IDE along with their VCS tool.
